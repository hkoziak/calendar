## Calendar option for CRM system
Nowadays, in a company with a lot of workers it is hard to keep everything planned and organised properly.
This tool is supposed to be helpful in managing efforts and resources as well 
by displaying planned tasks (with all needed data stored in CRM system) in the corporate calendar.
## How does it works?
This repository contains very simplified CRM system prototype with html wildcard for displaying sellers
(workers), their clients and all current tasks. Data is stored in separated .json files, so when 
calendar view needed, it is displayed in a new tab with Google Calendar in <iframe> tag.
If you want to try this by yourself, using [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
is highly recommended. Also,make sure you have [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) installed to run web pages. All other needed
libraries can be found in requirements.txt file.
